; AUTOMATIC TOOL CHANGER NGC SUBROUTINE FILE - MAZAK-VQC1540 mill
; Author: Timothy Snowden / Solid Rock Development
;         (inspired by Vismach toolchange.ngc by Andy Pugh)
; Notes: 
; - All atc-related functions connected in this file
; - ALL MOVES PRECEDED BY G53 (move in machine coord's - NOT modal!)
; - M66 (wait for digital input) - result stored in #5399, timeout = -1
; - Standard param's exposed by change_prolog/eval'd by change_epilog:
;    #<tool_in_spindle>
;    #<selected_tool>
;    #<current_pocket>
;    #<selected_pocket>

; DEFINE DIGITAL INPUTS:
; P0 = atc-arrive-request (move tool into ATC, but don't engage chain)
; P1 = atc-exit-request (PLC request to exit toolchanger magazine)
; P2 = atc-finished-request (PLC request to complete the tool change)
; P3 = skip-unload (PLC confirms that unload will be skipped)

; DEFINE DIGITAL OUTPUTS:
; P0 = tool-change (signals PLC that a tool change is in progress)
; P1 = atc-arrived (signals PLC that tool is in ATC 'wait' position)
; P2 = atc-exited (signals PLC that the tool/spindle exited the ATC)
; P3 = atc-tool-loading (signals PLC that ATC is in loading operation)

; DEFINE VARIABLES:
#<x-atc> = #<_ini[ATC]X_ATC>  ; X in line with the ATC
#<y-atc-mag> = #<_ini[ATC]Y_ATC_MAG>  ; Y in the magazine, but not in the tool chain
#<y-atc> = #<_ini[ATC]Y_ATC>  ; Y position to engage the tool chain
#<y-safe> = #<_ini[ATC]Y_SAFE>; Y safely outside the magazine
#<z-up> = #<_ini[ATC]Z_UP>  ; Z all the way up - highest clearance / safety
#<z-atc> = #<_ini[ATC]Z_ATC>  ; Z at level of ATC tool chain)
